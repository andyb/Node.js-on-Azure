A skeleton Windows Azure VS2010 solution with a worker role that houses windows native v.0.5 Node.js exe and binds it to port 80. You should be able to grab the source and run if you have Azure SDK and VS tools installed. 
As it is a worker role when you start the project you will need to open a browser and point to http://127.0.0.1 plus the port that the dev fabric has provided (usually 81 or 82).
